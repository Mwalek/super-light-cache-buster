Stop browser caching by randomizing asset version numbers.

== Description ==
Can't see the changes supposedly made by your developer? Temporarily activate this plugin.

Using less than 10 lines of code, this simple workaround adds random version numbers to CSS & JS assets to prevent browser caching getting in the way of your happiness. You can deactivate it immediately after or keep it active if the site is under development 😀.
