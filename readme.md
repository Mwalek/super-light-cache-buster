Stop browser caching by randomizing asset version numbers.

## Description

Can't see the changes supposedly made by your developer? Or maybe you're just tired of your site's annoying cache? Use this plugin to cache a break!

With a compressed size of under 21KB, this simple plugin adds random version numbers to CSS & JS assets to prevent page and browser caching getting in the way of your happiness.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I have to clear my cache for the plugin to work?

Yes, you should clear your cache(s)! This plugin doesn't clear pages that have already been cached (coming soon, shhh).

If you are still being served cached pages after activating the plugin, clear the cache at least once.

This will delete all pages/posts from the cache, and Cache Buster will prevent them from being cached again while the plugin is enabled :-).

### Does this plugin work on Multisite?

No, Cache Buster hasn't been tested on Multisite Networks.
