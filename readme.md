Stop page & browser caching with random version numbers and Cache-Control directives.

## Description

Can't see the changes supposedly made by your developer? Or maybe you're just tired of your site's annoying cache? Use this plugin to cache a break!

With a compressed size of under 30KB, this simple plugin adds random version numbers to CSS & JS assets to prevent browser caching getting in the way of your happiness.

Super Light Cache Buster also prevents page caching by using Cache-Control directives.

You can completely disable the plugin from the settings page when you are not using it or keep it enabled if the site is under development. ðŸ˜€

## Available Hooks

Cache Buster is becoming more developer friendly. Below you can find the plugin's first hooks and details about them.

    slcb_allow_in_backend

- Filters whether Cache Buster should run (randomize asset version numbers) in the back end.
- Return `true` to enable Cache Buster. `false` is the default.

<!-- end of the list -->

    slcb_version_name

- Filters the version name for assets to allow using a custom version name (or number).
- Return the version name e.g. you can use the value `2.0.1`.
- When this filter is in use, version numbers will not be randomized. Instead, you will have to change the version name manually to rename assets.
- This filter overrides the "Version Name" setting in the dashboard.
- The provided version name must be a valid query parameter. As a safety, if the provided string breaks any URLs, it will not be used.

## Installation

1. Upload the entire `super-light-cache-buster` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Clear all caches on your site and server (hosting).
4. Cache a break from caching :-).

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do I have to clear my cache for the plugin to work?

Yes, you should clear your cache(s)! This plugin doesn't clear pages that have already been cached (coming soon, shhh).

If you are still being served cached pages after activating the plugin, clear the cache at least once.

This will delete all pages/posts from the cache, and Cache Buster will prevent them from being cached again while the plugin is enabled :-).

### Does this plugin work on Multisite?

No, Cache Buster hasn't been tested on Multisite Networks.
